## 🤔 Why I Built This

As a frontend developer exploring **React.js**, I wanted to build a project that covers:

- API integration and handling async data
- Modern UI and responsive layouts
- Real-time interactivity with user input
- Enhanced user experience with animations

A Language Translator app was a perfect choice to implement these goals while also showcasing skills in **React Hooks**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**.
